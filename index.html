                <h5>
                    In 2018, 35% of the US population had an overweight classification, meaning they are overweight, obese or highly obese.</br>
                    Studies and surveys have proven that obesity is closely linked with many health risks, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke.<br/>
                    While almost one-third of Americans overweight, the statistics are very different when broken down on a state-level. Click on a state to find out more about it.

            <p class="story">
                    There are many racial and ethnic disparities on a national level when it comes to obesity and the factors that affect it. 
                    Looking at data from 2017, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and American Indian folks have an obese classification at disproportionately higher rates than their White and Asian counterparts. 
                    Along with this, 33% of Hispanic people and 24% of Non-Hispanic Black people report to eat vegetables less than one time daily, in comparison to 15% by White and Asian folks. 
                    A healthy diet that is rich in vegetables and complex nutrients is a key factor in preventing obesity. 
                    Fitness and exercise have also been proven to reduce obesity and many of its health risks, especially heart disease. 
                    We see here that the populations with the highest rates of obesity also are more likely to engage in no leisure time activity.

            <p class="story">
                Fast food restaurants continue to proliferate in the US, giving people
                more access to unhealthy food. While there is no absolute truth to the 
                correlation between fast food restaurants and the obesity rates throughout 
                the years, these restaurants do nothing to help the growing obesity crisis
                and can only contribute to it. Highlight a point on the chart to see the 
                exact values.

            <p class="story">
                America stands out in the world as a "melting pot" of vairous cultures,
                ethnicities, and races. Yet it seems no one can avoid the threat of obesity,
                regardless of who or where you are. In the following map, you may select between 
                various ethnicities and age groups to see where in the US are certain groups 
                affected most by obesity. Note that, based on denser ethnic populations in certain 
                states, values may differ on the average obesity for said state.
